 **HTML Elements Types**
 
Elements can be placed in two distinct groups: block level and inline level elements. The former make up the document's structure, while the latter dress up the contents of a block.

Also, a block element occupies 100% of the available width and it is rendered with a line break before and after. Whereas, an inline element will take up only as much space as it needs.

* All HTML elements can have attributes.
* Attributes provide additional information about elements.
* Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
* Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".
* for eg. 1. Use [text](url) for hyperlinks

:star:**<div> and <Span> tag**
  
  **div** tag should be used for grouping a set of related elements to create a relationship between them on a webpage, the **span** tag should be used to change the style of something on a webpage without affecting the context it is within.
